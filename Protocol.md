# Protocol for Review of Best Practices

### Clear Rationale and Objective:
The primary goal is to create a one-stop shop for all the best and most credible industry practices related to developing sustainable software. By having all these resources in one place, it will make it easier and more efficient for practitioners to learn about such practices. 

### Literature Search:
We spoke with an industry expert and used this as a starting point. From there, we were directed to other valuable resources. We created guidelines on how to select resources, with criteria such as relevance, credibility, and publication date.

### Screening Process:
To narrow down the literature, we established clear criteria for inclusion and exclusion. Multiple people were involved in the screening process to help remove bias and gather diverse perspectives. 

### Synthesis of Findings:
After screening, we categorised the findings into the following themes:  
- Energy and Resource Efficiency
- Software Architecture and Design
- Sustainable Development and Operations
- Sustainable Hardware and Infrastructure
- AI and Emerging Technologies.

We believe these categories encompass the key aspects of sustainable software development. By organizing the information in this way, it will allow users to easily navigate through the various practices and find what is most relevant to their needs.
