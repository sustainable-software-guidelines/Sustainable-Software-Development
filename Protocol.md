# Protocol for Review of Best Practices

### Objective:
This research aims to create a comprehensive and reliable repository of best practices for developing sustainable software. This collection will serve as a go-to resource for practitioners, making it easier for them to access credible, effective, and up-to-date sustainability practices. Our approach is designed to ensure the reliability of the practices included and their relevance to current industry standards.

### Literature Search:
Our literature search was initiated by consulting an industry expert with extensive knowledge as a foundational starting point for identifying key resources. We sought to gather a broad spectrum of materials but carefully evaluated each based on specific criteria.
To ensure we were drawing from high-quality sources, we created a structured set of selection guidelines that included:
- Relevance: The resource must align with the key aspects of sustainable software development
- Credibility: Only authoritative sources were included.
- Recency: The source must be relatively recent to reflect the latest trends and technologies in sustainability. 

This methodical approach to resource selection is critical to ensuring the integrity of our findings and that the practices identified reflect current, credible standards.

### Screening Process:
The screening process followed a systematic approach to reduce bias and ensure diverse perspectives. To achieve this, we established rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria:
- Inclusion Criteria: Resources that meet the relevance, credibility, and recency standards outlined earlier.
- Exclusion Criteria: Materials that are outdated, lack evidence of practical application, or have a commercial focus, including marketing materials or direct product or sales-related material.

Multiple reviewers participated in the screening process to help reduce personal biases and ensure a more holistic view. Each reviewer was tasked with independently evaluating resources based on the criteria, followed by group discussions to address potential discrepancies and ensure consensus. This process adds rigour to our methodology, minimising errors and providing greater reliability.

### Synthesis of Findings:
Following a rigorous screening and analysis process, the identified resources were evaluated, tested, and synthesised into five core categories. These themes were established to provide a clear, accessible, and comprehensive structure for sustainable software engineering best practices—reflecting the area’s most critical to reducing environmental impact across the software lifecycle.

The five categories are:

•	Energy and Resource Efficiency
•	Software Architecture and Design
•	Sustainable Development and Operations
•	Sustainable Hardware and Infrastructure
•	AI and Emerging Technologies

This categorisation is the result of a methodical review and consolidation of best 
practices drawn from research, industry experience, and real-world application. The structure is designed to be practical and easy to navigate—enabling users to pinpoint relevant practices quickly and apply them in context. It ensures depth and usability, supporting organisations in identifying the most effective levers for sustainable impact.
