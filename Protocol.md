# Protocol for Review of Best Practices

### Clear Rationale and Objective:
The objective of this research is to create a comprehensive and reliable repository of best practices for developing sustainable software. This collection will serve as a go-to resource for practitioners, making it easier for them to access credible, effective, and up-to-date sustainability practices. Our approach is designed to ensure the reliability of the practices included, as well as their relevance to current industry standards.

### Literature Search:
Our literature search was initiated through a consultation with an industry expert, whose extensive knowledge served as a foundational starting point for identifying key resources. We sought to gather a broad spectrum of materials, but carefully evaluated each based on specific criteria. To ensure we were drawing from high-quality sources, we created a structured set of selection guidelines that included:
- Relevance: The resource must align with the key aspects of sustainable software development
- Credibility: Only authoritative sources were included.
- Recency: The source must be relatively recent to reflect the latest trends and technologies in sustainability. 

This methodical approach to resource selection is critical to ensuring the integrity of our findings and that the practices identified are reflective of current, credible standards.

### Screening Process:
The screening process followed a systematic approach to reduce bias and ensure diverse perspectives. To achieve this, we established rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria:
- Inclusion Criteria: Resources that meet the relevance, credibility, and recency standards outlined earlier.
- Exclusion Criteria: Any materials that lacked clear evidence of practical application, were outdated, or came from questionable sources were excluded.

Multiple reviewers participated in the screening process to help reduce personal biases and ensure a more holistic view. Each reviewer was tasked with independently evaluating resources based on the criteria, followed by group discussions to address potential discrepancies and ensure consensus. This process adds rigor to our methodology, minimizing errors and providing greater reliability.

### Synthesis of Findings:
After screening, the identified resources were categorized into five major themes to create a logical and accessible structure. These categories cover the primary aspects of sustainable software development, and we believe they offer a comprehensive overview of the field:
- Energy and Resource Efficiency: 
- Software Architecture and Design: 
- Sustainable Development and Operations: 
- Sustainable Hardware and Infrastructure: 
- AI and Emerging Technologies: 

The categorization was carried out with the goal of making the findings as navigable and user-friendly as possible. By organizing the information into distinct, relevant themes, users can quickly locate the practices most relevant to their specific needs, ensuring both clarity and utility.
