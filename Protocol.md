# Protocol for Review of Best Practices

### Objective:
This research aims to create a comprehensive and reliable repository of best practices for developing sustainable software. This collection will serve as a go-to resource for practitioners, making it easier for them to access credible, effective, and up-to-date sustainability practices. Our approach is designed to ensure the reliability of the practices included and their relevance to current industry standards.

### Literature Search:
Our literature search was initiated by consulting an industry expert with extensive knowledge as a foundational starting point for identifying key resources. We sought to gather a broad spectrum of materials but carefully evaluated each based on specific criteria.
To ensure we were drawing from high-quality sources, we created a structured set of selection guidelines that included:
•	Relevance: The resource must align with the key aspects of sustainable software development
•	Credibility: Only authoritative sources were included.
•	Recency: The source must be relatively recent to reflect the latest trends and technologies in sustainability. 

This methodical approach to resource selection is critical to ensuring the integrity of our findings and that the practices identified reflect current, credible standards.

### Screening Process:
The screening process followed a systematic approach to reduce bias and ensure diverse perspectives. To achieve this, we established rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria:
•	Inclusion Criteria: Resources that meet the relevance, credibility, and recency standards outlined earlier.
•	Exclusion Criteria: Any materials lacking clear evidence of practical application, outdated, or from questionable sources were excluded.

Multiple reviewers participated in the screening process to help reduce personal biases and ensure a more holistic view. Each reviewer was tasked with independently evaluating resources based on the criteria, followed by group discussions to address potential discrepancies and ensure consensus. This process adds rigour to our methodology, minimising errors and providing greater reliability.

### Synthesis of Findings:
After screening, the identified resources were categorised into five major themes to create a logical and accessible structure. These categories cover the primary aspects of sustainable software development, and we believe they offer a comprehensive overview of the field:
•	Energy and Resource Efficiency: 
•	Software Architecture and Design: 
•	Sustainable Development and Operations: 
•	Sustainable Hardware and Infrastructure: 
•	AI and Emerging Technologies: 

The categorisation was done to make the findings as navigable and user-friendly as possible. Organising the information into distinct, relevant themes allows users to quickly locate the practices most pertinent to their specific needs, ensuring clarity and utility.
