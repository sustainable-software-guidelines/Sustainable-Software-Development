This is a backlog of feedback we've received, which we will review and address in the next iteration of the repository.

|Client               | Category          | Positive     | Improvement      |
|------------------------|-------------------|--------------|------------------|
|**HSBC** | Content | Overall liked the context/setting the scene & problem statement. |  |  
| | Resources | Helpful links to understand more about a wide variety of topics. |  | 
| |  Context | I liked the brief overview of each section to give some context before going into the information in the link that was more detailed.|  |  
| | User Accessibility | Everything was really well labelled, and I could navigate to the section I needed easily. |The only improvement I thought of in terms of user accessibility, was maybe for each section you could have the links directly under the main folder, rather than having multiple subfolders to make navigating a bit easier.| |
|**Cognizant**| Context | The GitHub repository presents a well-curated and forward-thinking foundation for sustainable software engineering, particularly across architecture, operations, and governance. |  | 
| | User Accessibility |  | Some referenced links (e.g., Oâ€™Reilly publications) require purchase or trial access, which limits their practical use for engineering teams. We recommend consolidating such links into a reference index rather than maintaining them as standalone files. | 
| | Coverage |  | To achieve comprehensive alignment with sustainable software engineering standards, we suggest future iterations address the following areas. Testing & QA: No coverage of sustainable testing practices or CI/CD pipeline optimization. Security & Privacy: Limited integration of privacy-aware sustainability principles. Tooling & Automation: Minimal detail on developer tooling and automation pipelines. Roles & Collaboration: Absence of role-specific responsibilities for embedding sustainability across teams. Metrics & KPIs: Underrepresentation of quantitative indicators for tracking sustainability maturity.| 
| |Maintenance |  | Clarity on how the repository will be maintained post-publication. Regular updates and validation of links will be essential to ensure continued relevance and  usability. | 
|**Capgemini**| General | Overall, your approach and materials you have developed is good and very good starting point to develop these resources further.  |  | 
|  | Resources | Through the lens of people using this resource as guide to develop their knowledge across a range of topics and the opportunity to deep dive further into different materials. We think is useful as hub to navigate to other resources. | Suggested builds to be added are from SustainableIT.org and Sustainable Architectures communities. From SustainableIT.org: IT Standards for Environmental, Social, and Governance Sustainability and the SustainableIT Standards Taxonomy. Then under AI & Emerging technologies, content from Sustainable Architectures for example The IT Toolkit for Responsible  and Sustainable AI  and Sustainable AI for Greener | 
|**PA Consulting**| User Accessibility |  | Review the ordering of the technical levels in the table. | 
|**Mastek**| Content |  | Consider whether data is covered under the existing categories or is better suited to be its own category. | 
|**Sage**| Accessibility|Good collection of resources  which are well grouped and labeled. The repository acts as a valuable starting point for the discovery of resources, most of which were new to me.  | Alter folder structure: instead of the subfolders with markdown files linking to each source, link the resources in the overview table. <br> Point users to specific, relevant sections within the resources.  <br> Structure of the repo might benefit of some sort of quick wins/introductory checklist and ways to measure those outcomes. <br> Classifying content by audience: Focus on personas, such as the specific job roles identified by the self-assessment. <br> Links to Green Software Foundation are to the GitHub source code for their site, it would be more useful if it was to the site itself. <br> The AWS well architected sustainability pillar is available in HTML documentation; it would be more useful to link this than the PDF, and that also allows for more specific deep-linking.|
