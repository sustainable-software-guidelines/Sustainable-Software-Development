|Client               | Category          | Positive     | Improvement      |
|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|------------------|
|**HSBC** | Content | Overall liked the context/setting the scene & problem statement. |  |  
| | Resources | Helpful links to understand more about a wide variety of topics. |  | 
| |  Context | I liked the brief overview of each section to give some context before going into the information in the link that was more detailed.|  |  
| | User Accessibility | Everything was really well labelled, and I could navigate to the section I needed easily. |The only improvement I thought of in terms of user accessibility, was maybe for each section you could have the links directly under the main folder, rather than having multiple subfolders to make navigating a bit easier? Although I understand this may be done to make it a bit tidier! | |
