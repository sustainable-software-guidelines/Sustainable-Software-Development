This is a backlog of feedback we've received, which we will review and address in the next iteration of the repository.

|Client               | Category          | Positive     | Improvement      |
|------------------------|-------------------|--------------|------------------|
|**HSBC** | Content | Overall liked the context/setting the scene & problem statement. |  |  
| | Resources | Helpful links to understand more about a wide variety of topics. |  | 
| |  Context | I liked the brief overview of each section to give some context before going into the information in the link that was more detailed.|  |  
| | User Accessibility | Everything was really well labelled, and I could navigate to the section I needed easily. |For each section have the links directly under the main folder, rather than having multiple subfolders to make navigating a bit easier.| |
|**Cognizant**| Context | The GitHub repository presents a well-curated and forward-thinking foundation for sustainable software engineering, particularly across architecture, operations, and governance. |  | 
| | User Accessibility |  | Some referenced links (e.g., O’Reilly publications) require purchase or trial access, which limits their practical use for engineering teams. We recommend consolidating such links into a reference index rather than maintaining them as standalone files. | 
| | Coverage |  | To achieve comprehensive alignment with sustainable software engineering standards, we suggest future iterations address the following areas. <br> Testing & QA: No coverage of sustainable testing practices or CI/CD pipeline optimization. <br> Security & Privacy: Limited integration of privacy-aware sustainability principles. <br> Tooling & Automation: Minimal detail on developer tooling and automation pipelines. <br> Roles & Collaboration: Absence of role-specific responsibilities for embedding sustainability across teams. Metrics & KPIs: Underrepresentation of quantitative indicators for tracking sustainability maturity.| 
| |Maintenance |  | Clarity on how the repository will be maintained post-publication. <br> Regular updates and validation of links will be essential to ensure continued relevance and  usability. | 
|**Capgemini**| General | Overall, your approach and materials you have developed is good and very good starting point to develop these resources further.  |  | 
|  | Resources | Through the lens of people using this resource as guide to develop their knowledge across a range of topics and the opportunity to deep dive further into different materials. We think it is useful as hub to navigate to other resources. | Suggested builds to be added are from SustainableIT.org and Sustainable Architectures communities. <br> From SustainableIT.org: IT Standards for Environmental, Social, and Governance Sustainability and the SustainableIT Standards Taxonomy. <br> Then under AI & Emerging technologies, content from Sustainable Architectures for example The IT Toolkit for Responsible  and Sustainable AI  and Sustainable AI for Greener | 
|**PA Consulting**| User Accessibility |  | Review the ordering of the technical levels in the table. | 
| | Content |  | GSF resources should not be combined into one reference, as there are a few different ones - e.g. Course content vs. Green Software Paterns | 
|**Mastek**| Content |  | Consider whether data is covered under the existing categories or is better suited to be its own category. | 
|**Sage**| Accessibility|Good collection of resources  which are well grouped and labeled. The repository acts as a valuable starting point for the discovery of resources, most of which were new to me.  | Alter folder structure: instead of the subfolders with markdown files linking to each source, link the resources in the overview table. <br> Point users to specific, relevant sections within the resources.  <br> Structure of the repo might benefit of some sort of quick wins/introductory checklist and ways to measure those outcomes. <br> Classifying content by audience: Focus on personas, such as the specific job roles identified by the self-assessment. <br> Links to Green Software Foundation are to the GitHub source code for their site, it would be more useful if it was to the site itself. <br> The AWS well architected sustainability pillar is available in HTML documentation; it would be more useful to link this than the PDF, and that also allows for more specific deep-linking.|
||Content| A really strong collection of resources and definitly can give benefits to engineers. Some of the linked contant I already know, but the majority was new to me.| Link and classify resources. <br> Providing engineers with an easy way of measuring benefit/changes would be really useful. <br> Add quick wins/introductory checklist and ways to measure those outcomes. |
| | Coverage | | Focus on testing would be welcome for our QA engineer colleagues |
| | Insights | | Provide a meta-analysis of the linked resources to identify the most common and effective actions and patterns likely to apply to most organisations.| 
|**Mastek**| Accessibility | Clear 5-category structure aligns well with the software lifecycle. <br> Descriptive file names and structured folders make resources easy to locate. <br> Technical expertise tables and the self-assessment tool provide engineers with guided entry points. <br> The platform is easy to use once you’re familiar with it. | Flatten the folder structure – placing resources directly under main categories would reduce clicks. <br> Explore search/filter tags (e.g., technology stack, company size, implementation complexity). <br> Introduce cross-category links since many practices span multiple areas. <br> Sections & structure: while the current breakdown references the right materials, I’d get more value from a Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced view across all domains rather than repeating inside each section. |
| | Content | Real-world tested practices from global banks and industry leaders add credibility. <br> Quantified impact claims (e.g., 25–50% energy reduction) strengthen the business case. <br> Multi-level technical guidance ensures accessibility across varying expertise levels. <br> Consolidation of frameworks into one hub saves engineers time and effort. |  Add a “Quick Start” guide for engineers who want immediate, actionable impact. <br> Add an overview/index in the main README to help new users quickly orient themselves. <br> Implementation templates (code snippets, configuration samples, CI/CD examples). <br> ROI calculators to justify sustainability investments. <br> Integration guides for embedding sustainability practices into workflows and DevOps pipelines. <br> Role-specific quick references for architects, developers, DevOps, and managers. <br> Data Management category (lifecycle, storage optimization, transfer efficiency). <br> Testing & QA practices for sustainable CI/CD. <br> Developer tooling (IDE plugins, linters, VS Code extensions). <br> Security–sustainability intersection (privacy-aware green practices). <br> Self-assessment: I understand the intent, but I didn’t find it that helpful in practice. Fewer, sharper questions would be better, with demographic questions optional or tagged onto the end. <br> Highlights it would be useful to see where the key “nuggets of information” are, inclusion of some deeper links, so I could jump straight to the relevant section. |
| | Coverage | | Maturity assessment framework to help teams measure progress. <br> Case study templates for consistent sharing of implementations. <br> Metrics dashboard examples (KPIs and measurement frameworks). <br> Accessibility improvements (offline summaries, mobile-friendly quick references, reduced reliance on external paid resources). <br> One area that could make the repo even stronger is improving visibility into practices that are under review and recently updated. This would help contributors (both new and existing) quickly understand where they can engage and how they can participate. <br> Create a drafts folder to track practices currently being worked on. Use GitHub labels like draft-practice, review-needed, and update-required at the top of each practice file. <br> A dedicated page (say TOPICS_BACKLOG.md or IDEAS.md) that lists all topics that are yet to be added or suggested for future work. This would act like a backlog and a contributor entry point. <br> Updates: be able to see what's changed.  <br> Coverage gaps: more emphasis on DevOps and testing would add real value, because if development practices are going to change, we need to bake this into the CI/CD process and be on the lookout for issues early in the dev cycle. e.g. Red Hat have also published some useful practices and tools around Kubernetes and Cloud Carbon Footprint (5 ways to build sustainability into your software architecture) I know this is now dated but something like this to show how sustainability can be embedded directly in a practical way. <br> External perspectives: bringing in additional consultancy points of view on emerging trends and evidence of commercial impact would be useful. |
| | Maintenance | | Maintain a CHANGELOG.md or use GitHub Actions to auto-generate changelog entries whenever practice files are updated.|
| **Bupa** | Layout | | Shorten and bullet point the welcome paragaphs - it is quite a lot to read. |
| | Accessibility | | Change title of the summary table to improve clarity on what it represents, for example 'Summary Resources Table by category'. <br> Reorder content: put the summary table after the Table of Contents so people can see all the things available first off and then choose to review resources if an when they want to. <br> All of the sections in the table of contents should be hyperlinked. |
|**Standard Bank**| Content | A good, comprehensive set of resources. Useful to engineers. | |
| | Accesibility | README is a good starting point, provides a detailed overview of the repository. | |
| **ITU** | Content | | Add a TechUK Green Coding Toolkit in the next iteration.|
